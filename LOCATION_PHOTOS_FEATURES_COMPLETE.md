**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All features implemented and tested

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **1. Save & Share Functionality**

- ✅ **Optimistic UI** - Instant feedback with graceful error handling
- ✅ **Auth-Aware** - Shows appropriate messages for unauthenticated users

**Features:**
```tsx
<LocationPhotoActions 
  locationId={location.id}
  locationName={location.name}
  locationSlug={location.slug}
/>
```

**Behavior:**
- 📱 **Mobile:** Uses native share sheet (iOS/Android)
- 💻 **Desktop:** Shows social share menu with all platforms
- 🔒 **Auth Required:** Save button requires sign-in
- ✅ **Reuses Global Components:** Uses `SocialShare` component

---

### **2. Community Features (Delete & Set Featured)**

---

### **3. Security Enhancements**

**API Routes Updated:**
- ✅ `/api/admin/set-featured-image` - Added auth check
- ✅ `/api/admin/delete-location-image` - Added auth check

**Security Pattern:**
```typescript
// Check authentication
const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (authError || !user) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Unauthorized - Please sign in' },
    { status: 401 }
  )
}
```

**Protection:**
- ✅ Client-side auth checks (UX)
- ✅ Server-side auth checks (security)
- ✅ Proper error messages
- ✅ No data leaks
