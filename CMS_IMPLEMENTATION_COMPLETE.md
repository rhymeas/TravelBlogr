// NEW: Import new unified CMS
import { TripCMS } from '@/components/trips/TripCMS'

// In the component:
<TripCMS
  tripId={trip.id}
  userId={user.id}
  trip={trip}
  posts={trip.posts || []}
  onUpdate={fetchTrip}
  canEdit={canEdit}
/>
```

- ✅ Checks `canEdit` prop before rendering
- ✅ RLS policies enforce server-side security

### Data Validation
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Type checking with TypeScript
- ✅ Supabase schema validation

### Error Handling
- ✅ Try/catch blocks
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Drag-and-drop reordering** - UI is ready but functionality not implemented
2. **Rich text editing** - Uses plain textarea (could be enhanced)
3. **Bulk operations** - No multi-select or bulk actions yet
4. **Undo/redo** - No version history or undo functionality
