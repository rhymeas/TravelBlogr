## Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-4) - Foundation

### 1.1 Database Schema Updates

**Objective:** Add location copying and attribution tracking to database

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `original_location_id` UUID field to `locations` table
- [ ] Add `creator_id` UUID field to `locations` table  
- [ ] Add `current_owner_id` UUID field to `locations` table
- [ ] Add `visibility_status` VARCHAR field (private/public/shared)
- [ ] Add `modification_permissions` JSONB field
- [ ] Add `is_deleted` BOOLEAN field (soft deletes)
- [ ] Create `location_versions` table for version history
- [ ] Create `location_attribution` table for tracking credits
- [ ] Add indexes for efficient querying
- [ ] Create migration file and test in Supabase

**Success Criteria:**
- All new fields present in Supabase
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Indexes improve query performance by 50%+

## Questions & Clarifications Needed

1. Should we implement soft deletes or hard deletes for locations?
2. What's the maximum number of versions to keep per location?
3. Should attribution be automatic or require user confirmation?
4. How should we handle permission conflicts in collaborative scenarios?
5. What's the priority: speed or feature completeness?
