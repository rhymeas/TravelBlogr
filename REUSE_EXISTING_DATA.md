# ðŸ”„ Reuse Existing Replit Database & Storage

## Perfect! Keep Your Existing Data

Instead of creating new database and storage, we'll connect Railway to your existing:
- âœ… **Neon Database** (with all your tour data)
- âœ… **Google Cloud Storage** (with all your images)

## Railway Environment Variables Setup

In Railway dashboard â†’ Variables tab, add these **exact same values from Replit**:

### **Database (from Replit)**
```
DATABASE_URL=your_existing_neon_database_url_from_replit
```

### **Google Cloud Storage (from Replit)**
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_existing_gcp_project_id
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_existing_service_account_json
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=your_existing_bucket_paths
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=your_existing_private_dir
```

### **Admin (new for Railway)**
```
ADMIN_TOKEN=kandareise-admin-2025-secure
NODE_ENV=production
```

## How to Get Values from Replit

1. **Go to your Replit project**
2. **Click "Secrets" tab** (lock icon)
3. **Copy these exact values:**
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` 
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
   - `PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS`
   - `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR`

## Railway Setup (Modified)

1. **Create Project** â†’ Deploy from GitHub repo
2. **Skip adding PostgreSQL** (we're using existing Neon)
3. **Add Environment Variables** (from above)
4. **Deploy!**

## Benefits

âœ… **Zero data migration** - everything stays the same
âœ… **Same URLs** - all your images work immediately  
âœ… **Same database** - all locations, photos, settings preserved
âœ… **Instant switch** - just change where the app runs
âœ… **Cost savings** - no duplicate storage/database costs

## Cost

- **Railway**: $5/month (app hosting only)
- **Neon Database**: Keep existing plan
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Keep existing usage
- **Total**: Just +$5/month for Railway hosting

Your Kandareise app will have exactly the same data, just running on Railway instead of Replit!
