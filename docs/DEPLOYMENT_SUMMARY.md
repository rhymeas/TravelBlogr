## 📊 Deployment Timeline

### Initial Attempt
- ❌ **Issue:** "Missing Supabase environment variables"
- ❌ **Issue:** "502 Bad Gateway" on custom domain
- ❌ **Issue:** "Not Found - train has not arrived" on Railway subdomain

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Public domain not generated** in Railway
2. **Environment variables not set** in Railway
3. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables require rebuild** (not just restart)

### Resolution Steps
1. ✅ Generated Railway public domain
2. ✅ Added all environment variables to Railway
3. ✅ Triggered rebuild by pushing code change
4. ✅ Configured custom domain DNS
5. ✅ Verified deployment success

## 🔑 Key Learnings

### 1. Environment Variables in Next.js

**Critical Understanding:**

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION: These can be changed at runtime
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...

// ✅ REALITY: These are baked into the build at BUILD TIME
// Changing them requires a REBUILD, not just a restart!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Next.js replaces `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` with actual values during build
- Client-side code gets these values hardcoded in JavaScript bundles
- Changing them in Railway without rebuilding = old values still in code

**Solution:**
- Always trigger a rebuild after changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
- Use `git commit --allow-empty -m "Rebuild"` to force rebuild
- Or manually redeploy in Railway dashboard

### 2. Railway Networking Configuration

**Public Domain Must Be Generated:**

```
Railway → Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
```

Without this:
- ❌ Railway subdomain returns 404
- ❌ Custom domain can't connect
- ❌ App is running but not accessible

**Custom Domain Setup:**
1. Generate Railway domain first
2. Test Railway domain works
3. Add custom domain in Railway
4. Configure DNS CNAME
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 min)

### 3. Railway Build Process

**Correct Configuration:**
- **Root Directory:** Blank (auto-detected)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (from package.json)
- **Start Command:** `npm start` (from package.json)
- **Port:** Auto-detected from logs (8080)

**Don't Set:**
- ❌ PORT environment variable (Railway auto-detects)
- ❌ Custom build commands (unless necessary)
- ❌ Wrong root directory

### 4. DNS Configuration

**GoDaddy CNAME Setup:**

```
Root Domain (@):
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: travelblogr-production.up.railway.app
TTL: 600

WWW Subdomain:
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: travelblogr-production.up.railway.app
TTL: 600
```

**Propagation Time:**
- Typical: 5-30 minutes
- Maximum: 24-48 hours
- Check: https://dnschecker.org

## 🎓 Best Practices Established

### Development Workflow
1. ✅ Always test locally before deploying
2. ✅ Use feature branches (never push to main)
3. ✅ Run type-check and lint before commit
4. ✅ Test production build locally (`npm run build`)
5. ✅ Review changes before committing

### Deployment Workflow
1. ✅ Check pre-deployment checklist
2. ✅ Monitor build logs during deployment
3. ✅ Test critical features immediately after deploy
4. ✅ Monitor logs for 10-15 minutes post-deploy
5. ✅ Have rollback plan ready

### Environment Management
1. ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to git
2. ✅ Document all environment variables
3. ✅ Use Railway Variables tab for production
4. ✅ Rebuild after changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars
5. ✅ Keep service role key secret (server-side only)
