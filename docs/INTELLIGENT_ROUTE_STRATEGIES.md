# 🎯 Intelligent Route Strategies

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## 📋 Overview

TravelBlogr now uses **intelligent, context-aware route differentiation** instead of random geometric waypoints. Routes are optimized based on:

1. **Fastest Route**: Direct, efficient path (baseline)
2. **Scenic Route**: Routes through natural features (coastlines, mountains, viewpoints, national parks)
3. **Longest Route**: Routes through POI-rich areas (more cities, attractions, experiences)

---

## 🏞️ Scenic Route Strategy

### **Goal:**
Create routes that pass through **actual scenic features**, not just random detours.

### **Data Sources:**
- **Overpass API (OpenStreetMap)** - Free, unlimited
- Queries for:
  - Viewpoints (`tourism=viewpoint`)
  - Mountain peaks (`natural=peak`)
  - Waterfalls (`natural=waterfall`)
  - Coastlines (`natural=coastline`)
  - Rivers (`waterway=river`)
  - Lakes (`natural=water`)
  - National parks (`boundary=national_park`)
  - Scenic roads (`highway[scenic=yes]`)

### **Algorithm:**

```typescript
1. Calculate bounding box between start and end points (with buffer)
2. Query Overpass API for scenic features in area
3. Score each feature:
   - Viewpoints: 100 points (highest priority)
   - Mountains: 90 points
   - Coastlines: 85 points
   - National parks: 80 points
   - Lakes: 75 points
   - Rivers: 70 points
   - Penalty: -2 points per km from direct route
4. Select top-scoring waypoint(s) within max detour (30%)
5. Route through waypoint(s) using OSRM
6. Fallback to geometric waypoint if no features found
```

### **Example: Vancouver → Banff**

**Before (Random Waypoint):**
- Random perpendicular detour
- No scenic value
- 1,193km, 18h

**After (Intelligent Scenic):**
- ✅ Through Squamish (Sea-to-Sky Highway)
- ✅ Through Whistler (mountain resort)
- ✅ Through Lillooet (canyon views)
- ✅ Through Clearwater (rivers, waterfalls)
- Real scenic route with natural features!

## 🎯 Longest Route Strategy

### **Goal:**
Create routes that maximize **experiences and POIs**, not just distance.

### **Data Sources:**
- **OpenTripMap API** - Free tier (5,000 requests/day)
- Queries for POI density:
  - Tourist attractions
  - Cultural sites
  - Natural features
  - Restaurants/cafes
  - Activities

### **Algorithm:**

```typescript
1. Calculate midpoint between start and end
2. Generate sample points perpendicular to direct route
   - Offsets: 30%, 50%, 70% from midpoint
   - Both sides of route (6 sample points total)
3. Query POI density at each sample point (10km radius)
4. Select point with highest POI count
5. Route through POI-rich waypoint using OSRM
6. Fallback to geometric waypoint if no POI-rich areas found
```

### **Example: Vancouver → Banff**

**Before (Random Waypoint):**
- Random perpendicular detour
- No POIs, just empty roads
- 2,068km, 29h

**After (Intelligent POI-Rich):**
- ✅ Through Kelowna (wineries, restaurants, attractions)
- ✅ Through Vernon (cultural sites, activities)
- ✅ Through Revelstoke (mountain town, ski resort)
- More experiences, not just longer distance!

## ⚡ Fastest Route Strategy

### **Goal:**
Direct, efficient route (baseline for comparison).

### **Algorithm:**
```typescript
1. Use OSRM direct route
2. No waypoints, no detours
3. Fastest possible path
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Files:**

1. **`apps/web/lib/services/scenicRouteService.ts`**
   - `findScenicWaypoints()` - Query Overpass API for natural features
   - `findPOIRichWaypoints()` - Query OpenTripMap for POI density
   - Scoring and selection algorithms

2. **`apps/web/lib/services/routingService.ts`**
   - Updated to use intelligent waypoint selection
   - Fallback to geometric waypoints if APIs fail

### **API Calls:**

**Scenic Route:**
```typescript
// Overpass API query
const query = `
  [out:json][timeout:25];
  (
    node["tourism"="viewpoint"](bbox);
    node["natural"="peak"](bbox);
    node["natural"="waterfall"](bbox);
    way["natural"="coastline"](bbox);
    way["waterway"="river"](bbox);
    way["boundary"="national_park"](bbox);
  );
  out center;
`
```

**Longest Route:**
```typescript
// OpenTripMap API query
const url = `https://api.opentripmap.com/0.1/en/places/radius?
  radius=10000&
  lon=${lng}&
  lat=${lat}&
  kinds=interesting_places,tourist_facilities,cultural,natural&
  limit=100&
  apikey=${apiKey}`
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### **Vancouver → Banff Test Case:**

| Route Type | Distance | Duration | Waypoints | Quality |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Fastest** | 848km | 11h | 0 | ✅ Direct |
| **Scenic (Old)** | 1,193km | 18h | 1 random | ❌ No scenic value |
| **Scenic (New)** | ~1,100km | ~17h | 2-3 scenic | ✅ Real scenic features |
| **Longest (Old)** | 2,068km | 29h | 1 random | ❌ Empty roads |
| **Longest (New)** | ~1,400km | ~20h | 1-2 POI-rich | ✅ More experiences |

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Before:**
- ❌ "Scenic" route was just a random detour
- ❌ "Longest" route was pointlessly long
- ❌ No context or meaning to route choices

### **After:**
- ✅ "Scenic" route actually goes through scenic areas
- ✅ "Longest" route maximizes experiences and POIs
- ✅ Routes have meaning and context
- ✅ Users can see WHY a route is scenic or longer

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Phase 2: User Preferences**
```typescript
interface ScenicPreferences {
  preferCoastline: boolean
  preferMountains: boolean
  preferNationalParks: boolean
  preferViewpoints: boolean
}

// Example: "I want a coastal scenic route"
const waypoints = await findScenicWaypoints(
  start,
  end,
  30,
  { preferCoastline: true }
)
```

### **Phase 3: POI Categories**
```typescript
interface POIPreferences {
  categories: ('cultural' | 'nature' | 'food' | 'adventure')[]
  minRating: number
}

// Example: "I want a food-focused longest route"
const waypoints = await findPOIRichWaypoints(
  start,
  end,
  50,
  { categories: ['food'], minRating: 4.0 }
)
```

### **Phase 4: Multi-Waypoint Optimization**
- Instead of 1-2 waypoints, optimize for 3-5 waypoints
- Create true "scenic loops" or "POI tours"
- Balance detour vs. scenic value

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Page:**
`http://localhost:3000/test/route-strategies`

### **Test Cases:**
1. **Canadian Rockies** - Vancouver → Banff
2. **European Alps** - Munich → Innsbruck → Zurich
3. **California Coast** - San Francisco → Monterey
4. **Australian Outback** - Sydney → Canberra → Melbourne
5. **Japan Scenic** - Tokyo → Mt Fuji → Kyoto
6. **South African Garden Route** - Cape Town → Knysna → Port Elizabeth

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Scenic routes pass through actual scenic features
- ✅ Longest routes pass through POI-rich areas
- ✅ Routes are 20-50% longer than fastest (not 100%+)
- ✅ Fallback to geometric waypoints works if APIs fail

---

## 📝 Notes

### **API Limits:**
- **Overpass API**: Free, unlimited (but rate-limited)
- **OpenTripMap**: 5,000 requests/day (free tier)
- Both are sufficient for production use

### **Caching:**
- Routes are cached in database
- Scenic features could be cached per region
- POI density could be cached per area

### **Error Handling:**
- Graceful fallback to geometric waypoints
- Timeout protection (25 seconds for Overpass)
- Retry logic for API failures
