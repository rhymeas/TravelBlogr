- [ ] Measure GROQ costs
- [ ] Optimize prompts for cost

**Files to Modify:**

- `lib/itinerary/application/use-cases/GenerateItineraryUseCase.ts`

**Success Criteria:**
- GROQ pre-processing: <2s
- GROQ validation: <3s
- GROQ gap filling: <5s
- Cost: <$0.005/trip
- POI quality improvement: >20%

---

### Phase 8: External API Integration (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Add free tourism APIs for better POI coverage

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Get Foursquare API key (free tier: 950 calls/day)
- [ ] Get Yelp API key (free tier: 5000 calls/day)
- [ ] Implement Foursquare service
- [ ] Implement Yelp service
- [ ] Implement Wikidata service
- [ ] Implement Nominatim service
- [ ] Test POI quality improvements
- [ ] Monitor API usage

**Files to Create:**
- `lib/services/foursquareService.ts`
- `lib/services/yelpService.ts`
- `lib/services/wikidataService.ts`
- `lib/services/nominatimService.ts`

**Files to Modify:**
- `lib/services/comprehensivePOIService.ts` (add new sources)

**API Keys Needed:**
```bash
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=...
YELP_API_KEY=...
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Foursquare: Restaurant/cafe data
- Yelp: Reviews and ratings
- Wikidata: Structured attraction data
- Nominatim: Enhanced geocoding
- POI coverage: >90% of locations

---

### Phase 9: Testing & Optimization (Week 7)
**Goal:** Test at scale and optimize performance

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test with 100 trips
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates (target: >80%)
- [ ] Monitor API usage (target: <1000/day)
- [ ] Monitor costs (target: <$10/month)
- [ ] Optimize batch sizes
- [ ] Optimize cache TTLs
- [ ] Fix any bugs found

**Success Criteria:**
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- API calls: <1000/day
- Cost: <$10/month for 1000 trips/day
- No errors in production

---

### Phase 10: Production Rollout (Week 8)
**Goal:** Gradual rollout to production

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Enable flags for internal users
- [ ] Monitor for 3 days
- [ ] Enable for 10% of users
- [ ] Monitor for 3 days
- [ ] Enable for 50% of users
- [ ] Monitor for 3 days
- [ ] Enable for 100% of users
- [ ] Document learnings

**Success Criteria:**
- No increase in error rates
- Improved response times
- Reduced API costs
- Positive user feedback

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps

### Step 1: Test Current Implementation
```bash
# Enable feature flags
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SMART_POI=true" >> .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_BATCH_PROCESSING=true" >> .env.local

# Restart server
npm run dev

# Test admin dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/admin/feature-flags

# Test blog enrichment
open http://localhost:3000/test-enrichment

# Test trip planning
open http://localhost:3000/plan
```

### Step 2: Start Phase 5 (Progressive Loading)
1. Create `useProgressivePOIs` hook
2. Add progress indicators to UI
3. Test with real data

### Step 3: Start Phase 6 (Monitoring)
1. Create storage stats API
2. Build monitoring dashboard
3. Add cleanup cron job

## üìù Notes

- All phases are independent and can be worked on in parallel
- Feature flags allow gradual rollout of each phase
- Monitoring should be implemented early to track progress
- External APIs are optional but recommended for better coverage
- GROQ orchestration is the most complex phase (2 weeks)

## üöÄ Ready to Execute!

All planning is complete. Ready to start Phase 5 (Progressive Loading UI).
