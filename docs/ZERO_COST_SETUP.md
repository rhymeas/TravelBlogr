## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### **Check System Health**

Visit `/admin/costs` to see:
- Groq usage status
- Helicone request count
- Supabase storage usage
- Railway deployment status

### **Database Maintenance**

Run these queries monthly in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check notes count
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_location_notes) as location_notes,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_activity_notes) as activity_notes,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_restaurant_notes) as restaurant_notes;

-- Check sample gallery views
SELECT title, view_count 
FROM sample_travel_guides 
ORDER BY view_count DESC;

-- Check user growth
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as new_users
FROM auth.users
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Admin Access Denied**
- **Problem:** Can't access `/admin`
- **Solution:** Ensure email contains "admin" or equals "admin@travelblogr.com"

### **Notes Not Saving**
- **Problem:** "Save Note" button doesn't work
- **Solution:** Run migration `007_user_notes_system.sql`

### **Gallery Shows "Coming Soon"**
- **Problem:** No sample guides visible
- **Solution:** Run migration `008_sample_gallery.sql`

### **Helicone Not Tracking**
- **Problem:** No requests showing in Helicone dashboard
- **Solution:** 
  1. Verify `HELICONE_API_KEY` is set in Railway
  2. Restart Railway deployment
  3. Make a test AI request (create itinerary)
  4. Check Helicone dashboard (may take 1-2 minutes)

### **TypeScript Errors on Deploy**
- **Problem:** Build fails with TS errors
- **Solution:** Run locally first:
  ```bash
  npm run type-check
  npm run build
  ```
