    "conversionRate": 0,
    "topUsers": [
      {
        "userId": "user-123",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "hits": 5
      }
    ],
    "dailyTrend": [
      {

  }

## 🔄 User Flow Changes

### Before:
```
User generates plan → Hit free tier limit → Modal blocks generation → Must purchase
```

### After:
```
User generates plan → Can preview for free → Hit limit when saving → Modal shows balance → Can purchase
```

**Result:** Better UX, more conversions, less friction

| **Total Limit Hits** | Demand for paid features |
