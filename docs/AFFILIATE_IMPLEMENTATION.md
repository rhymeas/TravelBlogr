### **Step 2: Configure Environment Variables**

Add your affiliate IDs to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Affiliate Programs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID=your_booking_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GETYOURGUIDE_PARTNER_ID=your_getyourguide_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VIATOR_PARTNER_ID=your_viator_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_AIRBNB_AFFILIATE_ID=your_airbnb_id_here  # Optional
```

**Important:**
- These are `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables (safe for client-side)
- Replace `your_*_id_here` with actual IDs from affiliate dashboards
- Links will work without IDs but won't earn commission
- Console warnings in dev mode if IDs missing

---

### **Step 3: Deploy to Production**

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add affiliate revenue system"

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin main

# 3. Update Railway environment variables
# Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Variables
# Add all NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID etc.

# 4. Trigger rebuild (required for NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars)
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild for affiliate env vars"
git push origin main
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are baked into the build at BUILD TIME. You MUST rebuild after adding/changing them!

## üìä Tracking & Analytics

### **Google Analytics Events**

All affiliate clicks send this event:

```javascript
gtag('event', 'affiliate_click', {
  provider: 'booking.com',      // Which affiliate
  location: 'Paris',            // Which location
  context: 'itinerary_modal',   // Where clicked
  timestamp: '2025-01-15T...'   // When clicked
})
```

### **View Events in Google Analytics**

1. Go to Google Analytics 4
2. Navigate to: Events ‚Üí affiliate_click
3. View breakdown by:
   - `provider` - Which affiliate is most popular
   - `location` - Which destinations get most clicks
   - `context` - Which page drives most clicks

### **Expected Click-Through Rates**

Based on industry benchmarks:

| Context | CTR | Reason |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Itinerary Modal | 15-25% | Users actively planning |
| Location Page | 5-10% | Users browsing |
| Trip Page | 3-7% | Users reading |

## üí∞ Revenue Projections

### **Conservative Estimates (Month 1)**

Assumptions:
- 1,000 monthly active users
- 50% use itinerary planner
- 15% click affiliate links
- 5% convert to bookings
- Average booking value: $200
- Average commission: 15%

**Calculation:**
```
1,000 users √ó 50% planners = 500 planners
500 planners √ó 15% CTR = 75 clicks
75 clicks √ó 5% conversion = 3.75 bookings
3.75 bookings √ó $200 √ó 15% = $112.50/month
```

### **Optimistic Estimates (Month 6)**

Assumptions:
- 10,000 monthly active users
- 60% use itinerary planner
- 20% click affiliate links
- 8% convert to bookings
- Average booking value: $300
- Average commission: 20%

**Calculation:**
```
10,000 users √ó 60% planners = 6,000 planners
6,000 planners √ó 20% CTR = 1,200 clicks
1,200 clicks √ó 8% conversion = 96 bookings
96 bookings √ó $300 √ó 20% = $5,760/month
```

### **Revenue by Provider**

| Provider | Commission | Avg Booking | Revenue/Booking |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Booking.com | 25-40% | $200 | $50-80 |
| Airbnb | 3% | $400 | $12 |
| GetYourGuide | 8-12% | $100 | $8-12 |
