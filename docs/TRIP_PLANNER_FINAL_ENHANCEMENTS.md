## ✅ 1. Transport Mode Update: Bus → Bike

### Changes Made

**File: `apps/web/components/itinerary/TransportModeSelector.tsx`**

- Replaced `Bus` icon with `Bike` icon from lucide-react
- Updated transport mode type: `'bus'` → `'bike'`
- Changed average speed: 60 km/h → 20 km/h (realistic for cycling)
- Updated label: "Bus / Coach" → "Bike / Cycling"
- Updated description: "Budget-friendly travel" → "Eco-friendly, active travel"
- Changed color: "orange" → "teal"

**Updated Transport Modes:**
| Mode | Icon | Avg Speed | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 🚗 Car | Car | 80 km/h | Flexible stops, scenic routes |
| 🚂 Train | Train | 100 km/h | Comfortable, city-to-city |
| 🚴 Bike | Bike | 20 km/h | Eco-friendly, active travel |
| ✈️ Flight | Plane | 500 km/h | Long distances, major cities |
| 🔀 Mixed | Shuffle | 80 km/h | Combination of methods |

### Type Updates

**File: `apps/web/lib/itinerary/application/use-cases/GenerateItineraryUseCase.ts`**
```typescript
transportMode?: 'car' | 'train' | 'bike' | 'flight' | 'mixed'
```

## ✅ 2. Pro Planner Toggle Redesign

### Changes Made

**File: `apps/web/components/itinerary/ItineraryGenerator.tsx`**

**Before:**
- Large, prominent toggle component with gradient background
- Positioned after Transport Mode section
- Used dedicated `ProPlanToggle` component
- Took up significant vertical space

**After:**
- Compact inline toggle in gray background
- Positioned BEFORE Transport Mode section (higher in form)
- Inline implementation (no separate component needed)
- Minimal visual footprint

**New Design:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-3 bg-gray-50 rounded-xl border border-gray-200">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Pro Planner</span>
    <span className="px-2 py-0.5 bg-purple-100 text-purple-700 text-[10px] font-bold rounded-full">
      BETA
    </span>
  </div>
  <button /* toggle switch */ />
</div>
```

**Visual Comparison:**

Before:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✨ Pro Planner                         │
│  Enhanced AI with reasoning model       │
│  [Large Toggle Switch]                  │
│  • Advanced reasoning AI model          │
│  • Detailed transportation analysis     │
│  • Optimized route suggestions          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

After:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Pro Planner [BETA]        [Toggle]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ 3. Enhanced Pro Planner AI with Reasoning

### Changes Made

**File: `apps/web/lib/itinerary/application/services/EnhancedGroqAIService.ts`**

### 3.1 Improved System Prompt

**Key Enhancements:**
1. **Strict JSON Output** - Emphasized that ONLY JSON should be returned
2. **Detailed Schema** - Provided comprehensive field descriptions
3. **Validation Rules** - Specified requirements for each item type
4. **Realistic Constraints** - Added rules for timing, costs, and durations

**New System Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
{
  role: 'system',
  content: `You are an expert travel planner with advanced reasoning capabilities.

CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks.

Your task is to create a detailed, optimized travel itinerary by:
1. Analyzing the route, distances, and transportation mode
2. Calculating realistic travel times based on the chosen transport mode
3. Balancing travel days with exploration time
4. Considering the user's interests, budget, and preferences
5. Providing detailed, actionable recommendations

Output Schema (STRICT JSON):
{
  "title": "string - Creative trip title",
  "summary": "string - 2-3 sentence overview",
  "days": [...],
  "totalCostEstimate": number,
  "tips": ["string - Practical travel tips"]
}

Rules:
- Each day must have 4-8 items
- Travel items must include from, to, mode, distance
- Activity items must have realistic durations
- Meal items should be at appropriate times
- Cost estimates must be realistic for the budget level
- Tips should be specific and actionable`
}
```

### 3.2 Enhanced Context Building

**New `buildEnhancedPrompt()` Method:**

**Structured Sections:**
```

### 3.3 Transport-Specific Strategies

**New `getTransportStrategy()` Method:**

Provides mode-specific recommendations:

**Car Strategy:**
- Plan scenic routes and roadside attractions
- Include parking information and costs
- Suggest rest stops every 2-3 hours
- Consider fuel costs (~$0.15/km)
- Recommend departure times to avoid traffic

**Train Strategy:**

- Suggest booking advance tickets for savings
- Plan around train schedules (typically hourly)
- Recommend seat reservations for long journeys

**Bike Strategy:**
- Plan routes with bike-friendly paths
- Include rest stops every 15-20km
- Suggest accommodations with bike storage
- Consider elevation changes and difficulty
- Recommend early starts to avoid heat/traffic

**Flight Strategy:**

- Include airport transfer times (2-3h before flight)
- Suggest booking flights in advance
- Plan activities near airports on travel days
- Consider baggage allowances and costs

**Mixed Strategy:**
- Optimize transport mode per segment
- Use trains for medium distances (100-500km)
- Use flights for long distances (>500km)
- Use local transport within cities
- Provide cost comparison for each segment

### 3.4 Enhanced Validation

**New `validateAndEnhanceResult()` Method:**

Ensures AI output meets requirements:
1. Validates JSON structure
2. Checks for required fields
3. Adds missing fields with defaults
4. Enhances travel items with transport mode
5. Calculates total cost if missing
6. Logs validation results
