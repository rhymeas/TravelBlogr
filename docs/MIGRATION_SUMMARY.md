## Database Schema

### Trips Table (Public Templates)
```sql
is_public_template = true
status = 'published'
user_id = (first admin user)
```

### Posts Table (Day-by-Day Content)
```sql
trip_id → trips.id
order_index = day_number
content = description + activities + tips
```

### Trip Stats
```sql
trip_id → trips.id
total_views = migrated view_count
unique_views = 0 (initialized)
```

## Next Steps
