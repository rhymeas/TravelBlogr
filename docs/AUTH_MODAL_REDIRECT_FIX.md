# Auth Modal Redirect Fix - Summary

## 🎯 Problem

When a user gets logged out while on a protected page (e.g., `/dashboard/trips/[tripId]`), the login modal appears but cannot be dismissed. Clicking the close button or backdrop just hides the modal, leaving the user stuck on a page they can't access.

**User Experience Before:**
1. User is on `/dashboard/trips/8f6ea7d3-34d6-40b2-b1c7-126395ec0773`
2. Session expires or user logs out
3. Login modal appears
4. User clicks close button or backdrop
5. ❌ Modal closes but user is still on the protected page
6. ❌ User sees "Please sign in..." message but can't do anything
7. ❌ User is stuck and confused

## ✅ Solution

Updated the auth modal logic to automatically redirect users to the home page when they close the modal without signing in while on a protected route.

**User Experience After:**
1. User is on `/dashboard/trips/8f6ea7d3-34d6-40b2-b1c7-126395ec0773`
2. Session expires or user logs out
3. Login modal appears
4. User clicks close button or backdrop
5. ✅ Modal closes AND user is redirected to home page (`/`)
6. ✅ User can browse public content or sign in from header
7. ✅ Clear, expected behavior

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Updated `AuthModalContext.tsx`

**Added:**
- `useRouter` and `usePathname` hooks for navigation
- `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array defining routes that require authentication
- Logic in `hideSignIn()` to check if user is on protected route
- Automatic redirect to home page if closing modal without signing in

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Define protected routes
const PROTECTED_ROUTES = ['/dashboard', '/trips', '/profile', '/settings']

// Updated hideSignIn function
const hideSignIn = (userSignedIn = false) => {
  setIsOpen(false)
  setRedirectTo(undefined)
  
  // Only redirect if user did NOT sign in and is on a protected route
  if (!userSignedIn) {
    const isOnProtectedRoute = PROTECTED_ROUTES.some(route => 
      pathname?.startsWith(route)
    )
    
    if (isOnProtectedRoute) {
      router.push('/')
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated `SignInModal.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `onClose` prop signature from `() => void` to `(userSignedIn?: boolean) => void`
- Pass `true` to `onClose(true)` when user successfully signs in
- Pass `false` to `onClose(false)` when user clicks close button or backdrop

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Updated interface
interface SignInModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean
  onClose: (userSignedIn?: boolean) => void  // ← Added parameter
  redirectTo?: string
}

// On successful sign in
if (result.success) {
  toast.success('Welcome back!')
  onClose(true)  // ← Pass true
  // ...
}

// On close button/backdrop click
<button onClick={() => onClose(false)}>  // ← Pass false
  <X className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-600" />
</button>
```

### 3. Updated `/auth/signin/page.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `handleClose` function to accept `userSignedIn` parameter
- Only redirect to home if user didn't sign in

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
const handleClose = (userSignedIn = false) => {
  setIsModalOpen(false)
  // If user signed in and there's a redirect, the modal will handle it
  // If user didn't sign in, redirect to home
  if (!userSignedIn) {
    router.push(redirect || '/')
  }
}
```

## 📋 Protected Routes

The following routes are considered protected and will trigger redirect on modal close:

- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/dashboard/trips` - User trips list
- `/dashboard/trips/[tripId]` - Individual trip pages
- `/dashboard/trips/[tripId]/edit` - Trip editing
- `/trips` - Any trips-related pages
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/settings` - User settings

**Note:** Public routes like `/`, `/locations`, `/trips-library` are NOT protected and won't trigger redirect.

## 🔄 Flow Diagrams

### Scenario 1: User Closes Modal Without Signing In (Protected Route)

```
User on /dashboard/trips/abc123
    ↓
Session expires
    ↓
Modal appears (showSignIn called)
    ↓
User clicks close button
    ↓
onClose(false) called
    ↓
hideSignIn(false) called
    ↓
Check: Is on protected route? YES
    ↓
router.push('/') → Redirect to home
    ↓
User sees landing page
```

### Scenario 2: User Signs In Successfully (Protected Route)

```
User on /dashboard/trips/abc123
    ↓
Session expires
    ↓
Modal appears (showSignIn called)
    ↓
User enters credentials and signs in
    ↓
onClose(true) called
    ↓
hideSignIn(true) called
    ↓
Check: userSignedIn? YES
    ↓
No redirect (stay on current page)
    ↓
User continues on /dashboard/trips/abc123
```

### Scenario 3: User Closes Modal on Public Route

```
User on / (home page)
    ↓
Clicks "Sign in" button
    ↓
Modal appears
    ↓
User clicks close button
    ↓
onClose(false) called
    ↓
hideSignIn(false) called
    ↓
Check: Is on protected route? NO
    ↓
No redirect (stay on current page)
    ↓
User continues on / (home page)
```
