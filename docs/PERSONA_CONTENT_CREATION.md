## üîß Technical Implementation

### Batch Blog Generation Flow

1. **User selects trips** in `/dashboard/batch`
2. **Frontend calls** `POST /api/batch/blog-posts`
3. **Use case executes:**
   - Fetches trips with related data
   - For each trip:
     - Gets trip owner's persona from database
     - Builds persona-specific GROQ prompt
     - Includes writing style, expertise, preferences
   - Submits batch to GROQ API
   - Creates batch job record
4. **GROQ processes** batch (async, 50% cheaper)
5. **Webhook receives** results (future implementation)
6. **Blog posts created** with persona's voice

### Key Files

- **Personas:** `scripts/create-team-personas.ts`
- **Round 1 Content:** `scripts/create-persona-trips.ts`
- **Round 2 Trips:** `scripts/create-persona-trips-round2.ts`
- **Batch Dashboard:** `apps/web/components/batch/BatchGenerationDashboard.tsx`
