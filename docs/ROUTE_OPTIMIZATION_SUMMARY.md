# Route Calculation Optimization - Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** 🧪 ITERATION 1 - TESTING PHASE  
**Approach:** Data-driven optimization following Brave API success pattern

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Following the successful Brave API query optimization (11 POI tests → 85-90% accuracy), we're now applying the same rigorous testing methodology to route calculation.

### The Challenge
TravelBlogr needs to provide 3 different route types:
- **Fastest** ⚡ - Minimize travel time (highways, toll roads)
- **Shortest** 📏 - Minimize distance (direct path)
- **Scenic** 🏞️ - Maximize experience (avoid highways, scenic roads)

**Current Problem:** We don't know if our routing providers (OpenRouteService, OSRM) actually deliver what users expect for each route type.

---

## 🧪 Testing Approach

### Iteration 1: Global Diversity Test
**5 test cases × 3 route types = 15 route calculations**

#### Test Cases
1. **🏔️ European Alps** - Munich → Innsbruck → Zurich (mountain route)
2. **🌊 California Coast** - San Francisco → Monterey (coastal route)
3. **🏜️ Australian Outback** - Sydney → Canberra → Melbourne (desert route)
4. **🗾 Japan Scenic** - Tokyo → Mount Fuji → Kyoto (island route)
5. **🦁 South African Garden Route** - Cape Town → Knysna → Port Elizabeth (safari route)

#### Why These Routes?
- **Geographic diversity:** Mountains, coast, desert, islands, safari
- **Distance variety:** 180 km to 1000 km
- **Waypoint variety:** 2-point and 3-point routes
- **Infrastructure variety:** Developed and developing countries
- **Scenic potential:** All routes have scenic alternatives

---

## 📊 Testing Methodology

### User Rating System
- **✓✓ Excellent** - Route is perfect for this route type
- **✓ Good** - Route is acceptable with minor issues
- **✗ Poor** - Route is wrong or has major issues

### Automated Analysis
After all tests complete, system automatically analyzes:
1. **Success Rate** - % of routes that work correctly
2. **Route Type Performance** - Which type is most reliable
3. **Provider Comparison** - OpenRouteService vs OSRM
4. **Geographic Patterns** - Which regions work best
5. **Distance Impact** - How route length affects accuracy

---

## 🔧 Current Implementation

### Routing Service
**File:** `apps/web/lib/services/routingService.ts`

**Provider Hierarchy:**
```
1. OpenRouteService (Primary)
   - 2,000 requests/day
   - Supports: fastest, shortest, scenic
   - Best for: Detailed preferences

2. OSRM Demo Server (Fallback)
   - Unlimited requests
   - Supports: driving, cycling, foot
   - Best for: Basic routing

3. Database Cache
   - Caches all routes
   - Reduces API calls
   - Key: coordinates + profile + preference
```

**Current Route Types:**
```typescript
type RoutePreference = 'fastest' | 'shortest' | 'scenic' | 'longest'
```

**Special Handling:**
- **Scenic:** Uses ORS with `avoid_features: ['highways']`
- **Longest:** Uses OSRM alternatives, picks longest route
- **Fastest/Shortest:** Direct ORS preference mapping

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenarios

#### High Accuracy (>80% Excellent/Good)
**Action:** ✅ Current implementation is production-ready
- Document best practices
- Add inline comments
- Deploy with confidence

#### Medium Accuracy (50-80%)
**Action:** 🔄 Iterate and refine
- Test alternative strategies
- Combine multiple providers
- Add custom logic for problem areas

#### Low Accuracy (<50%)
**Action:** ❌ Major changes needed
- Research alternative APIs
- Implement custom route optimization
- Consider POI-based routing

---

## 🎯 Potential Improvements

### If Current Approach Fails

#### 1. Custom Scenic Route Logic
```typescript
// Fetch multiple route alternatives
const alternatives = await getOSRMAlternatives(coords)

// Score routes based on scenic criteria
const scored = alternatives.map(route => ({
  route,
  score: calculateScenicScore(route, scenicPOIs)
}))

// Return highest scoring route
return scored.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0].route
```

**Scenic Score Factors:**
- Proximity to scenic POIs (viewpoints, beaches, mountains)
- Avoidance of highways
- Road type (coastal, mountain, rural > urban)
- Elevation changes (mountains = scenic)

#### 2. Hybrid Provider Strategy
```typescript
// Use best provider for each route type
if (preference === 'fastest' || preference === 'shortest') {
  return await getOpenRouteServiceRoute(coords, preference)
} else if (preference === 'scenic') {
  // Try OSRM alternatives first
  const alternatives = await getOSRMAlternatives(coords)
  const scenic = selectMostScenic(alternatives)
  return scenic
}
```

#### 3. POI-Based Routing
```typescript
// Find scenic POIs along route corridor
const corridor = createRouteCorridor(from, to, width: 50km)
const scenicPOIs = await findScenicPOIs(corridor)

// Generate route that passes through POIs
const route = await generateRouteWithWaypoints(
  from,
  scenicPOIs.slice(0, 3), // Top 3 scenic spots
  to
)
```

#### 4. Machine Learning Approach
```typescript
// Train model on user-rated routes
const model = trainRouteQualityModel(historicalRatings)

// Predict route quality before showing
const quality = model.predict(route)
if (quality < 0.7) {
  // Try alternative route
}
```
