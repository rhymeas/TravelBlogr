# 🔧 Dropdown & Footer Fixes - October 16, 2025

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Trips Dropdown Not Showing on Deployed App**

**Problem:** Dropdown only worked on hover, not on mobile/touch devices

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added click handler: `onClick={() => setShowTripsMenu(!showTripsMenu)}`
- ✅ Added chevron rotation animation
- ✅ Now works on BOTH hover AND click
- ✅ Better mobile support

### 2. **Footer Links - 8 Broken Links Fixed**

**Problem:** Footer had links to non-existent pages (404 errors)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created `/contact` page with full contact form
- ✅ Removed 7 non-existent links (Help, Status, API Docs, About, Blog, Careers, Press)
- ✅ Added "Trips Library" to footer
- ✅ Simplified footer from 4 columns to 3 columns
