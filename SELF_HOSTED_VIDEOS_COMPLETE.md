## 💰 Cost Estimate

### **Supabase Storage Pricing:**

**Storage:** $0.021/GB/month  
**Bandwidth:** $0.09/GB

### **Your Usage:**

**Storage:** 14.62 MB = 0.0146 GB  
**Monthly storage cost:** 0.0146 × $0.021 = **$0.0003/month** (basically free!)

**Bandwidth (estimated 1000 page views/month):**  
1000 views × 14.62 MB = 14.62 GB  
**Monthly bandwidth cost:** 14.62 × $0.09 = **$1.32/month**

**Free tier includes:**
- 1 GB storage (you're using 0.0146 GB) ✅
- 2 GB bandwidth/month (covers ~137 views) ⚠️

**Verdict:** Very affordable! Even with 10,000 views/month, it's only ~$13/month.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **1. Test Locally:**

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000
```

**What to check:**
- ✅ Videos load and play automatically
- ✅ Smooth transitions between videos
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Fast loading (check Network tab)

### **2. Check Browser Console:**

Open DevTools (F12) → Console

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Video loaded successfully: caribbean"
- ✅ "Video loaded successfully: city"
- ✅ "Video loaded successfully: snow"
- ✅ "Video loaded successfully: desert"
- ✅ "Video loaded successfully: nature"

**If you see:**
- ⚠️ "Video failed to load: xxx, falling back to image"
  - This means the video URL is wrong or bucket is not public

### **3. Test Video URLs Directly:**

Open these URLs in your browser to verify they work:

```
https://nchhcxokrzabbkvhzsor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/uploads/4135118-sd_960_540_30fps.mp4
https://nchhcxokrzabbkvhzsor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/uploads/2282013-sd_640_338_24fps.mp4
https://nchhcxokrzabbkvhzsor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/uploads/1858244-sd_640_338_24fps.mp4
https://nchhcxokrzabbkvhzsor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/uploads/2055060-sd_640_268_25fps.mp4
https://nchhcxokrzabbkvhzsor.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/uploads/14190583_960_540_24fps.mp4
```

**Expected:** Videos should play directly in browser

### **4. Check Network Performance:**

1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "Media"
3. Refresh page
4. Check video load times

**Expected:**
- Desert: < 1 second
- Snow/City: 1-2 seconds
- Nature/Caribbean: 3-5 seconds

---

## 🔒 Security Check

### **Verify Bucket is Public:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Storage → images bucket
3. Settings → Make sure "Public bucket" is enabled ✅

If videos don't load, the bucket might be private!

---

## 🎨 Optional: Upload Poster Images

Currently using Pexels poster images. You can upload your own:

### **Extract Posters from Videos:**

```bash
# Install FFmpeg
brew install ffmpeg

# Extract poster from each video
ffmpeg -i 4135118-sd_960_540_30fps.mp4 -ss 00:00:02 -vframes 1 -q:v 2 caribbean-poster.jpg
ffmpeg -i 2282013-sd_640_338_24fps.mp4 -ss 00:00:02 -vframes 1 -q:v 2 city-poster.jpg

ffmpeg -i 14190583_960_540_24fps.mp4 -ss 00:00:02 -vframes 1 -q:v 2 nature-poster.jpg
```
