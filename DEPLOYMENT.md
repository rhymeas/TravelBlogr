# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes to production!)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect Node.js and start building

### Step 3: Add Database
1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway automatically connects it to your app

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard â†’ Variables tab, add:

```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account",...}
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=your-bucket/public
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=your-bucket/private
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secure-random-token
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migration
In Railway dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Deploy Logs, wait for build to complete, then:
1. Go to your app URL
2. The app will automatically initialize the database on first run

## Google Cloud Storage Setup

### Quick Setup (2 minutes):
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable Cloud Storage API
4. Create a storage bucket:
   - Name: `your-app-name-storage`
   - Location: `us-central1` (cheapest)
   - Access control: Fine-grained
5. Create service account:
   - IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts â†’ Create
   - Role: Storage Admin
   - Create key (JSON format)
6. Copy the entire JSON content for `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

### Environment Variables for Railway:
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"...","client_id":"...","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"..."}
PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS=your-bucket-name/public
PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR=your-bucket-name/private
ADMIN_TOKEN=generate-a-secure-random-string
```

## Cost Breakdown
- **Railway**: $5/month (includes app hosting + PostgreSQL)
- **Google Cloud Storage**: ~$0.50/month (for typical usage)
- **Total**: ~$5.50/month

## Post-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] App loads at Railway URL
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Image uploads work
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] All API endpoints respond

## Troubleshooting
- **Build fails**: Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- **Database connection error**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
- **Image upload fails**: Verify Google Cloud Storage credentials
- **404 errors**: Check if build completed successfully

## Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Railway dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records as shown
4. SSL certificate is automatic

Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
