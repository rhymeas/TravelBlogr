# 🔐 Authentication Modal Improvements

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Logo Everywhere**
Replaced old Globe icon logo with new paper plane logo across all authentication components.

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `apps/web/components/auth/SignInModal.tsx`
- ✅ `apps/web/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="w-8 h-8 bg-rausch-500 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
  <Globe className="h-5 w-5 text-white" />
</div>
<span className="text-xl text-sleek-black font-semibold">TravelBlogr</span>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<HeaderLogo />
```

### 2. **Removed Blurry Background Image**
Sign-in modal now appears as a clean overlay on the current page instead of showing a blurry travel image.

**Before:**
- Modal had left side with travel image
- Backdrop had `backdrop-blur-sm` effect
- Form was on right side (split layout)
- User couldn't see the page they were on

**After:**
- Clean centered modal card
- Simple semi-transparent backdrop (`bg-black/40`)
- No blur effect - page content visible behind modal
- Single column layout (no split)
- User stays in context of current page
