        introduction: 'Lisbon has been on my digital nomad radar for years, and I finally made it happen‚Äîtwo full months working remotely from Portugal\'s capital. Between the reliable WiFi, affordable cost of living, thriving nomad community, and those incredible sunset views from Miradouro de Santa Catarina, Lisbon quickly became one of my favorite bases. Here\'s my honest breakdown of what it\'s really like to work remotely from Lisbon, including the coworking spaces I tested, my productivity setup, and how I balanced work with exploring this incredible city.',

          'Found my perfect coworking space at Second Home with rooftop terrace',
          'Established a morning routine: surf at Carcavelos, work by 10 AM',

            description: 'First week was all about logistics. I\'d booked an sleek in Pr√≠ncipe Real for the first month‚Äîcentral location, great WiFi (tested it before booking!), and a proper desk setup. Spent the first few days testing coworking spaces: tried Second Home, Selina, Heden, and a few local spots. Second Home won for the vibe and the rooftop, but I kept a flexible membership to work from different spots. Also crucial: found my local caf√© (F√°brica Coffee Roasters), grocery store (Pingo Doce), and gym (Urban Sports Club membership works here!).',

            description: 'By week two, I\'d found my groove. Mornings: wake at 7 AM, quick workout or surf session at Carcavelos (30min train), back by 9:30 AM, work from 10 AM-1 PM. Lunch break with a proper Portuguese meal, then afternoon work session 2-6 PM. This schedule let me handle US timezone meetings (usually 5-7 PM Lisbon time) while still having evenings free. Productivity was actually higher than when I was in Bali‚Äîthe European work culture and reliable infrastructure made a huge difference. Plus, the nomad community here is super supportive.',

            tips: 'The 7-day Lisbon transport pass (‚Ç¨40) is worth it if you\'re commuting to beaches. Noise-canceling headphones are essential for caf√© work. Book meeting rooms at coworking spaces for important calls.'

            description: 'The second month was when Lisbon really felt like home. I\'d built a solid routine, made genuine friends in the nomad community, and even started a weekly accountability group with three other remote workers. We\'d meet every Monday at Second Home to set weekly goals, then Friday for a check-in (usually over wine at Time Out Market). My Portuguese improved enough to handle daily interactions, and I discovered the best spots for different types of work: Ler Devagar bookstore for creative work, Second Home for calls, F√°brica for deep focus. Also figured out the visa situation for longer stays‚ÄîPortugal\'s D7 visa is very nomad-friendly.',
