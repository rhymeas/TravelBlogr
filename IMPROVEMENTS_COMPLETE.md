# 🎉 TravelBlogr Improvements - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We Fixed

### **1. Load More Functionality** ✅

**Problem:** Too many restaurants and activities displayed at once (50 each)

**Solution:** Show only 6 by default with "Load More" button

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `apps/web/components/locations/LocationRestaurants.tsx`
- ✅ `apps/web/components/locations/LocationActivities.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Shows 6 restaurants by default
- ✅ Shows 6 activities by default
- ✅ "Load More" button shows remaining count
- ✅ "Show Less" button to collapse back
- ✅ Smooth transitions

---

### **2. FREE Image Fetching** ✅

**Problem:** No real images for locations and restaurants

**Solution:** Multi-tier image fetching strategy

**File Created:**
- ✅ `apps/web/lib/services/imageService.ts`

**Image Priority System:**

#### **For Locations:**
```
1. Manual URL (if provided) → Use it
2. Unsplash (if API key) → High quality, 50/hour
3. Pixabay (if API key) → Good quality, unlimited
4. Wikipedia → Free, unlimited
5. Placeholder → Fallback
```

#### **For Restaurants:**
```
1. Manual URL (if provided) → Use it
2. Generic food images → Unsplash direct URLs (no API)
3. Placeholder → Fallback
```

**Why Skip Auto-Fetch for Restaurants?**
- ✅ Saves API quota for locations
- ✅ Generic food images work great
- ✅ Restaurants change frequently
- ✅ Manual URLs still supported
