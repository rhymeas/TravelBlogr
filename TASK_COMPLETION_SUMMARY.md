## ⚠️ Known Issues

### **1. POIs Not Showing (CRITICAL)**
**Problem:** POI counts showing 0 in console logs

**Root Cause:** Missing `OPENTRIPMAP_API_KEY` environment variable

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
OPENTRIPMAP_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Get API Key:** https://opentripmap.io/product (Free tier: 5,000 requests/day)

**Verification:**
- Check server logs for: `❌ CRITICAL: OpenTripMap API key not configured!`
- Test with longer route (>50km) to ensure POI sampling works

---

### **2. Public Transport Info Not Implemented**
**Status:** Not yet implemented

**Requirements:**
- Fetch public transport provider names per location
- Add provider website URLs
- Display in location detail section

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Update Groq prompt to request public transport info
2. Add `publicTransport` field to location metadata
3. Display in `ItineraryModal` location section

---

### **3. Add Stop Along the Way (Partial)**
**Status:** UI complete, backend not implemented

**Current State:**
- ✅ AddStopModal component exists
- ✅ UI shows modal when clicking "+" on route
- ❌ Backend regeneration not implemented (shows alert)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create API endpoint `/api/itineraries/add-stop`
2. Call `GenerateItineraryUseCase` with updated stops array
3. Merge new plan with existing plan
4. Update modal state without closing

---

## 📋 Remaining Tasks (7/42)

### **Low Priority**
1. ❌ **Fix bike animation speed/clipping**
   - Slow down bike animation
   - Adjust viewBox/overflow
   - Ensure icons exist for all transport types

2. ❌ **Add loading placeholders/skeletons**
   - Standardize on `SmartImage` placeholder
   - Reserve dimensions to avoid layout shift

3. ❌ **Add day-level Regenerate controls**
   - UI to regenerate specific days
   - Options: focus, pacing, budget tweak
   - Merge results back into plan

4. ❌ **Admin analytics for cache efficiency**
   - Track cache hits/misses
   - Monitor generation time
   - Surface hit-rate and Groq-call savings

5. ❌ **Dashboard/trips page improvements**
   - General improvements to trips dashboard
