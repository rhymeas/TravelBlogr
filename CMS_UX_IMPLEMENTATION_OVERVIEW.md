## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- RLS policies enforce user permissions
- Attribution cannot be removed
- Soft deletes preserve data
- Version history is immutable

### Performance
- Optimized indexes for fast queries
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Caching strategy for popular locations
- Debounced search and autosave

### Scalability
- Soft deletes support data retention
- Version history is archived
- Attribution chain is tracked
- Indexes support growth
