## 📦 What Was Deployed

### Timeline Layout Improvements
1. **Fixed Title Overlap Issue**
   - First card no longer overlaps "This is how your trip could look like" section title
   - Added `index` prop to TripCard component
   - Conditional negative margin: only cards 2-4 have `-mt-48`

2. **Fixed Hydration Errors**
   - Added `daysStay` property to all trip examples (consistent data)
   - Removed random day generation from TripCard
   - Added `mounted` state to prevent auth-related hydration issues
   - Server and client now render identical content

3. **Improved Bubble Positioning**
   - Bubbles moved closer to cards (reduced distance by 45%)
   - Left cards: bubbles at `-right-[61px]`
   - Right cards: bubbles at `-left-[61px]`
   - Dotted connector lines: 45px width
   - Day counts properly centered in bubbles

4. **Maintained Design Integrity**
   - Zigzag timeline effect preserved for cards 2-4
   - Green timeline starts at proper height (`mt-24`)
   - Timeline line starts at title level (`top-3`)
   - All cards maintain proper left/right positioning

## 📊 Technical Details

### Changed Components
1. **`apps/web/app/page.tsx`**
   - Added `daysStay` to trip examples
   - Added `mounted` state for hydration fix
   - Reduced timeline margin from `mt-56` to `mt-24`
   - Pass `index` prop to TripCard

2. **`apps/web/components/ui/TripCard.tsx`**
   - Added `index` prop to interface
   - Added `isFirstCard` logic
   - Conditional negative margin based on index
   - Adjusted bubble positioning (106px → 61px)
   - Adjusted dotted line (90px → 45px)

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Trip examples now include daysStay
{
  id: '1',
  name: 'Banff National Park',
  dates: 'Sep 18-19',
  daysStay: 2,  // ← New property
  // ... other properties
}
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

1. **Hydration Error**
   - **Problem:** Random day generation caused server/client mismatch
   - **Solution:** Static `daysStay` property in data

2. **Title Overlap**
   - **Problem:** First card had `-mt-48` pulling it over title
   - **Solution:** Conditional margin based on card index

3. **Auth Hydration**
   - **Problem:** `useAuth()` caused different server/client renders
   - **Solution:** Added `mounted` state check

4. **Bubble Distance**
   - **Problem:** Bubbles too far from cards
   - **Solution:** Reduced distance by 45% (106px → 61px)
